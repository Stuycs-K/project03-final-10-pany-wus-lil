# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Yuchen Pan, 
       
# Intentions:

Uno card game

For at least two players, the server distributes 7 cards to each player. 

Cards are displayed to the players in texts. (Ex: r4, b7)

Order will be randomly selected. 

Player 1 takes the first turn, player 2 takes the second turn, etc


Turn ends when:

the client plays a card

the client draws at least one card and types “end”

the client has 0 cards in their hand


Error when:

play a card that is invalid or does not exist

play a different card from the card the player drew


When someone has 1 card, UNO is announced to all players


The game ends when: 

a player has 0 cards


After a player wins, the server tells all clients who won

Shut down the server and attach clients
